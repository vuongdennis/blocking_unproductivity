# Blocking UnProductive Applications

### Introduction
In this project, I wanted to build something that I would use on a daily basis. I thought this was an interesting idea to build upon as I'm someone who struggles with productivity. 

### What is it?
This is an application where the user is able to set aside time where they'll hopefully be less distracted. How the program works is that the user will set the designated time they want to work until. Ex: 3:15. During this time period, the user will be unable to open specific applications that they set to a blacklist.
